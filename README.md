# Waveform

Open-source Java application for visualizing audio files.

## Dependencies

All dependencies have their Windows executables bundled with the program. But on
other operating systems, the following programs must be installed in order to access
certain functionality:

- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html), required for video and GIF exports, as well as audio file conversion.
  Without FFmpeg, only `.wav` and `.mp3` files are supported.
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) is required for YouTube imports.
